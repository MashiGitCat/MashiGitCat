## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I am Maheshi and I love to code and make beautiful creations.** Sometimes it is a very big challenge for me but I love to be challenged and win them.
**WoderWriters is the project currently I am working on and , please find the repo and see how I am doing**
[Visit my website](https://find-maheshi.netlify.app/)

Technologies I am best at  **Typescript/Javascript/React/Next/MongoDB/MySQL/Node/Material UI/TailwindCSS/Bootstrap/REST API**

**This is my new Github account because my original one was hacked and I still didn't receive any support reply from the Github team.**
The Github team can ignore my request, yet I need  commits and push changes to repos and show people that I am a zealous programmer!
Wait here until I resolve my issue with Github!
The worst part is I miss a lot my contribution grid with green tiles, it was such a motivation for me!
