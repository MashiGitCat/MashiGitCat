**This is my new Github account because my original one was hacked and I still didn't receive any support reply from the Github team.**
The Github team can ignore my request, yet I need  commits and push changes to repos and show people that I am a zealous programmer!
Wait here until I resolve my issue with Github!
The worst part is I miss a lot my contribution grid with green tiles, it was such a motivation for me!
