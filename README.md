<p style="color: #FA9EBC;"><strong>NOTE: This is my new Github account because my original one was hacked and I still didn't receive any support reply from the Github team.</strong></p>
<p>The Github team can ignore my request, yet I need commits and push changes to repos and show people that I am a zealous programmer!</p>
<p>Wait here until I resolve my issue with Github!</p>
<p>The worst part is I miss a lot my contribution grid with green tiles, it was such a motivation for me!</p>
